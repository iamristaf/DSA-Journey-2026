# DSA Journey in Java 🚀

Starting **January 01, 2026**, I commit to learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** using **Java** and mastering them step by step.

This repository will contain **all my DSA code**, including:
- Practice problems
- Concept implementations
- Optimized solutions
- Continuous improvements as I learn

This is a long-term learning journey focused on:
- Strong problem-solving skills  
- Clear understanding of fundamentals  
- Writing clean and efficient Java code

Every line of code I write while learning DSA will live here.

**Consistency > Speed.  
Progress > Perfection.**
